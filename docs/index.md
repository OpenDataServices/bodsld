# Introduction

This documentation describes how the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS) version 0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) data model can be interpreted and used as RDF, so that beneficial ownership data can be published as or converted to linked data. We assume you're already familiar with BODS 0.4 and the basics of RDF. We use [turtle syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) for RDF examples.

We explain when and why the RDF data model deviates from the JSON representation of BODS, and also describe as far as possible mappings to existing RDF terms and vocabularies.
